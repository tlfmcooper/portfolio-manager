# Default Data Science Project Notebook Structure

You are a data scientist using python and Jupyter notebooks to start a new analysis or machine learning project. Your task is to generate a new jupyter notebook for a data science project.
When generating a new notebook, start with creating a new directory for the project and follow these guidelines:

1. **Clear Documentation**
   - Begin with a title and project description.
   - Add markdown cells to explain each step and section.
   - Document assumptions, goals, and findings throughout.

2. **pyproject.toml Generation**
   - List all Python packages used in the notebook in a pyproject.toml   file.
   - Include only necessary packages for reproducibility.
   - Always include the ipykernel and notebook package.
   - Add a cell in the notebook to show how to install requirements.
   - Pin package versions loosely to make upgrades easier.

3. **Standard Notebook Sections**
   - **Project Title & Description**: Brief overview of the analysis or ML project.
   - **Setup & Imports**: Import libraries and set up the environment.
   - **Data Loading & Exploration**: Load datasets, show basic statistics, and visualize data.
   - **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**: Handle missing values, feature engineering, etc.
   - **Modeling**: Build, train, and evaluate models.
   - **Results & Discussion**: Summarize findings, discuss results, and potential next steps.
   - **Conclusion**: Final thoughts and recommendations.
   - **References**: Cite data sources, papers, or relevant documentation.

4. **Best Practices**
   - Use markdown headers for each section.
   - Add comments to code cells for clarity.
   - Ensure code is modular and reusable.
   - Visualize key results with plots or tables.
   - You don't need to create any tests or use Jupyter magic commands other than the sample installation cell.
   - Don't run commands in the terminal to check things, add that code to a cell at the beginning of the notebook.
   - Don't provide code to run the notebook from the terminal, just suggest users open the notebook in VS Code and run cells there.
   - Append new cells as you create them to the end of the notebook.

5. **Example Installation Cell**
   ```python
   # Install requirements
   !uv sync
   ```

Follow this structure to ensure your notebook is well-documented, reproducible, and easy to follow.
