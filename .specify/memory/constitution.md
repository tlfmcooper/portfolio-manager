# Fullstack Advanced Portfolio Management App Constitution

## Core Principles

### Principle 1: Backend Technology Stack
The backend will be built with FastAPI, following modern API design principles.

### Principle 2: Frontend Technology Stack
The frontend will be a modern, responsive Vite application, ensuring a fast and interactive user experience.

### Principle 3: Database
The application will use SQLite for the database, suitable for portability and ease of setup. For future scalability, the database abstraction should allow for migration to more robust database systems.

### Principle 4: Platform
The application should be modern, responsive, and built for both web and mobile, providing a consistent user experience across devices.

## Technology Stack

The following technologies are mandated for this project:
- **Backend:** FastAPI
- **Frontend:** Vite (with React)
- **Database:** SQLite

## Development Workflow
