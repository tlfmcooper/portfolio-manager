## 🛠️ Prerequisites

### System Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab
- Internet connection (for data fetching)

### Installation
```bash
# From project root
pip install -e .

# Or install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Running the Notebooks
```bash
# Start Jupyter
jupyter notebook

# Or JupyterLab
jupyter lab

# Navigate to notebooks/ directory and open desired notebook
```

## ⚠️ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**1. Import Errors**
```python
# Make sure you're in the notebooks/ directory
# The notebooks automatically add ../src to the path
```

**2. Data Fetching Issues**
- Check internet connection
- Try with fewer symbols if Yahoo Finance is slow
- Some symbols may be temporarily unavailable

**3. Optimization Failures**
- Need at least 2-3 assets for optimization
- Some optimizations may not converge with certain data
- This is normal behavior - the notebooks handle errors gracefully

**4. Performance Issues**
- First run may be slower (data fetching)
- Subsequent runs faster (caching)
- Efficient frontier generation takes time

## 🎯 Key Features Demonstrated

### 📈 **Performance Analytics**
- Total and annualized returns
- Risk-adjusted metrics (Sharpe, Sortino, Calmar)
- Drawdown analysis
- Value at Risk (VaR) and Conditional VaR
- Multi-period performance comparison

### ⚡ **Risk Management**
- Correlation and covariance analysis
- Risk contribution by asset
- Portfolio concentration metrics
- Stress testing scenarios
- Monte Carlo simulation support

### 🎯 **Portfolio Optimization**
- Mean-variance optimization (Markowitz)
- Risk parity optimization
- Maximum Sharpe ratio
- Minimum variance
- Efficient frontier generation
- Custom constraint optimization

### 📊 **Advanced Features**
- Multiple asset types (stocks, ETFs, bonds, crypto)
- Custom date ranges and frequencies
- Caching for performance optimization
- Legacy EDHEC risk function support
- Comprehensive error handling

## 💡 Best Practices

### For Learning
1. Run cells sequentially
2. Modify parameters to see different results
3. Try different symbols and time periods
4. Experiment with optimization constraints

### For Production
1. Run comprehensive test first to validate environment
2. Monitor cache performance
3. Handle network timeouts gracefully
4. Validate optimization results

### For Research
1. Use custom date ranges for specific periods
2. Try different risk models
3. Experiment with alternative optimization objectives
4. Export results for further analysis
